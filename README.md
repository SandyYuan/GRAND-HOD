# GRAND-HOD: GeneRalized ANd Differentiable Halo Occupation Distribution

## Authors:
Sihan (Sandy) Yuan, Daniel Eisenstein & Lehman Garrison

## Introduction:
An Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD) code in Python that is differentiable and incorporates various generalizations to the standard HOD. The code takes a generalized HOD prescription as input and outputs the corresponding mock galaxy catalogs in binary files.

The code is currently written specifically for the Abacus simulations, but the main functionalities can be also easily adapted for other halo catalogs with the appropriate properties. We will update the code soon to support halo catalogs from other cosmological simulations. 

## Usage:

The code does not currently have dependencies other than basic Python packages. 

To install, simply download the script to the directory you want the mock catalogs to live in. If you are not on the Eisenstein Group computer clusters at CfA, you may need to change the 'directory' variable to point to the location of the simulation data. Keep the simulation box tag 'str(whichsim)' as an unknown variable.
